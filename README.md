`EasyTPP` is an easy-to-use development and application toolkit for [Temporal Point Process](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/TemporalPointProcess.html) (TPP), with key features in configurability, compatibility and reproducibility. We hope this project could benefit both researchers and practitioners with the goal of easily customized development and open benchmarking in TPP.
