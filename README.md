** We are actively updating the repo now. We will try to finish the first version in a few days. **

`EasyTPP` is an easy-to-use development and application toolkit for [Temporal Point Process](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/TemporalPointProcess.html) (TPP), with key features in configurability, compatibility and reproducibility. We hope this project could benefit both researchers and practitioners with the goal of easily customized development and open benchmarking in TPP.

## Features <a href='#top'>[Back to Top]</a>
<span id='features'/>

- **Configurable and customizable**: models are modularized and configurableï¼Œwith abstract classes to support developing customized
  TPP models.
- **Compatible with both Tensorflow and PyTorch framework**: `EasyTPP` implements two equivalent sets of models, which can
  be run under Tensorflow (both Tensorflow 1.13.1 and Tensorflow 2.0) and PyTorch 1.7.0+ respectively. While the PyTorch models are more popular among researchers, the compatibility with Tensorflow is important for industrial practitioners.
- **Reproducible**: all the benchmarks can be easily reproduced.
- **Hyper-parameter optimization**: a pipeline of [optuna](https://github.com/optuna/optuna)-based HPO is provided.


## Dataset <a href='#top'>[Back to Top]</a>
<span id='dataset'/>

We preprocessed one synthetic and five real world datasets from widely-cited works that contain diverse characteristics in terms of their application domains and temporal statistics:
- Synthetic: a univariate Hawkes process simulated by [Tick](https://github.com/X-DataInitiative/tick) library.
- Retweet ([Zhou, 2013](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/zhou13.pdf)): timestamped user retweet events.
- Taxi ([Whong, 2014](https://chriswhong.com/open-data/foil_nyc_taxi/)): timestamped taxi pick-up events.
- StackOverflow ([Leskovec, 2014](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/)): timestamped user badge reward events in StackOverflow.
- Taobao ([Xue et al, 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01753)): timestamped user online shopping behavior events in Taobao platform.
- Amazon ([Amazon Review, 2018](https://nijianmo.github.io/amazon/)): timestamped user online shopping behavior events in Amazon platform.

  All datasets are preprocess to the `Gatech` format dataset widely used for TPP researchers, and saved at [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1f8k82-NL6KFKuNMsUwozmbzDSFycYvz7) with a public access.
